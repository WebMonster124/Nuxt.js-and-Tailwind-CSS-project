**What is chaga mushroom?**

Chaga mushroom is quite different from your typical mushroom. For one, it looks nothing like a toadstool. It looks more like a nugget of gold or charcoal that grows out the side of a tree, and it is more reminiscent of a different type of mushroom: truffles. The biggest difference: chaga mushroom is hard as a rock!

Chaga _only_ grows out of birch trees in boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere such as Canada, Russia, and parts of the northern U.S. It transforms a birch compound, betulin, into an extremely healthy compound, betulinic acid (and contains tons of other health-boosting compounds, too).

**What is chaga mushroom coffee?**

When people find out what chaga mushroom coffee is, it may surprise them: it’s not a new thing at all. In fact, chaga mushroom coffee has been enjoyed probably for thousands of years.

Only back then it wasn’t considered a daily tonic or an imbibe-able, tasty coffee. It was instead boiled as a tea (or decoction) for combating weakness, illnesses, and reinvigorating health!

When ground up or processed, chaga mushroom becomes a coffee-like powder. And when made into a boiling tea or coffee, the taste is described as earthy with vanilla- and root beer-like flavor notes. (Sounds amazing doesn’t it?)

**What are the health benefits of chaga?**

Chaga mushroom coffee and tea have been sipped for centuries, if not possibly millennia, to restore health to the sick and weak.
