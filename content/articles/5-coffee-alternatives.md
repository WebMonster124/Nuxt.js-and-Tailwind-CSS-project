Cacao is a healthy way to enjoy the benefits and flavors of chocolate without the side effects of sugar, added calories, or fat. Many experts prefer brewed cocoa over coffee due to its low-caffeine content.

Introduced by the ancient Incans, cacao is a cocoa-bean version of coffee. The beans go through a complex process. They’re first dried, lightly fermented, roasted, and then ground.

These ground beans are used to make a hot beverage that is rich in flavor and aroma but contains no calories and very little sugar.

Just like coffee, cacao also offers several health benefits including [improved heart health](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/02/12/are-there-health-benefits-from-chocolate#:\~:text=Most%20dark%20chocolate%20is%20high,high%20blood%20pressure%20in%20adults.). Moreover, it contains antioxidants and flavonoids that help the body fight type II diabetes and improve cognitive health. Moreover, it can also give a boost to your mood.

There are several cacao products on the market but our favorite remains [Crio Bru](https://www.amazon.com/Crio-Bru-Substitute-Caffeine-Whole-30/dp/B005OCV044), a natural coffee alternative. It comes deliciously flavored with peppermint, natural coffee flavor, and vanilla.

## **#2 Lemon Water**

This might sound odd but lemon water can be a great alternative to coffee, especially if you're used to having a hot cup of caffeine when you wake up.

It improves the immune system and can be good for the skin as it helps create collagen.

Apple cider vinegar might not be the most popular coffee alternative but it's worth a try due to its many benefits. Made by fermenting crushed apples using bacteria and yeast, the drink offers several benefits including [a lower risk ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14694010)of type II diabetes.

It contains acetic acid, a compound that kills bacteria and strengthens the immune system. Just like coffee, apple cider vinegar also [assists with weight loss](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464618300483).

Make sure to dilute apple cider vinegar before you drink it as raw apple cider vinegar contains excessive acetic acid that can harm your teeth and result in other health issues. We suggest that you add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to one cup of water.

You can add sweeteners such as honey if the taste is too strong. Apple cider vinegar pills are also on the market but if you want a true coffee alternative then try products like [Dynamic Health Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar with Mother ](https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Health-Organic-Vinegar-Mother/dp/B00RHM0H2A/ref=sr_1_25?dchild=1&keywords=apple+cider+vinegar&qid=1612953400&sr=8-25)or [Bragg Organic Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar](https://www.amazon.com/Bragg-Organic-Unfiltered-Apple-Vinegar/dp/B001ID6MIC/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=apple+cider+vinegar+drink&qid=1612953928&sr=8-1).

If you want to enjoy the taste of coffee but without caffeine then get your hands on chicory coffee. It can be brewed into a delicious cup of hot beverage that offers several benefits including [improved digestion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27492975/), [reduced inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11497328/), and [decreased blood sugar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638225/).
