description: 'A hot cup of coffee and a nice jolt of caffeine are an indispensable part of many morning routines, but coffee on its own isn’t always the most palatable choice. Many people choose to add coffee creamer to their cups, which does a great job of masking any harsh or bitter flavors and adding a touch of sweetness to your daily drink.'

# Healthy Coffee Creamer Alternatives

1. [Laird Superfood Creamer](https://lairdsuperfood.com/collections/vegan-products/products/superfood-creamer-original)

If you want a plant-based coffee creamer that doesn’t sacrifice the texture, give Laird’s Superfood Creamers a try. Laird gets its delicious, creamy texture from coconuts, using both coconut milk and coconut sugar for flavor. Coconuts boast a world of health benefits, including medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), a type of healthy fat that has been shown to [boost energy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12634436/) and help with weight loss.

This brand also comes in several different flavors for every taste palette, making it a perfect alternative for someone who wants a close substitute for regular coffee creamer without the dairy.

2. [Califia Almond Milk Hazelnut Creamer](https://www.califiafarms.com/collections/creamers/products/hazelnut-creamer)

For those of us who love the classic nutty flavor of CoffeeMate’s Hazelnut Creamer but are looking for a healthier plant-based substitute, you don’t have to look much further than Califia’s Almond Milk Hazelnut Creamer. This coffee creamer substitute uses almond milk, which is low in calories but high in Vitamin E, as well as coconut cream to add a sweet and satisfying “cream” to your morning brew.

This brand also has several other flavors and varieties, including [Unsweetened](https://www.califiafarms.com/collections/creamers/products/unsweetened-almondmilk-creamer), [Better Half](https://www.califiafarms.com/collections/creamers/products/vanilla-better-half-32oz) (as an alternative to half-and-half), and [Keto Creamer](https://www.califiafarms.com/collections/creamers/products/unsweetened-vanilla-keto-creamer) so you can harness the power of almond milk no matter what your dietary and taste preferences.

3. [milkadamia](https://www.califiafarms.com/collections/creamers/products/hazelnut-creamer)[ Unsweetened Vanilla Creamer](https://milkadamia.com/product/milkadamia-creamer-unsweetened-vanilla-16oz/#483)

Here’s an ingredient we don’t think about very often: macadamia nuts! These tropical nuts are a fan-favorite when you’re lounging around in the islands, and now you can add them to your coffee in milk form to get a little sunshine in your morning routine. Macadamia nuts are great sources of both healthy fats and [B-complex vitamins](https://www.diabetichealthclinic.org/macadamia-nut-milk/), which are especially important if you’re eating a plant-based diet.

milkadamia uses macadamia milk and coconut cream to make a rich, vegan, and gluten-free coffee creamer alternative in flavored ([Chai](https://milkadamia.com/product/milkadamia-creamer-chai-16-oz/#5604), anyone?) _and_ unsweetened varieties.

4. [Coffee Booster](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0815ZMVBJ/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B0815ZMVBJ&pd_rd_w=1gdsc&pf_rd_p=4269e1a0-a218-4fbd-9748-1cd337d2f2a5&pd_rd_wg=Yuqnu&pf_rd_r=DGTY89QJC1GNG0JRVYK6&pd_rd_r=9d9d9cdb-d7b6-478a-ab9f-11f2a392466f&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTEU3TE4yVjVJQUJKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjk1NTYxMUFXU1MxS1pLMDRKRyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODk5ODE4MkVVRlFSWVMzSE4xQSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)

For those who follow a strict Keto plan, you’ll appreciate Coffee Booster. This healthy coffee creamer alternative is a high-fat, low-carb product that uses both coconut oil _and_ grass-fed ghee, or clarified butter, to deliver a filling creamer substitute that will keep you full and energized for the day.

On the downside, the ghee means that this product isn’t suitable for vegan diets, although you might not mind it if you’re a vegetarian. And since it is so high in fat, it carries more calories than some other coffee creamers, so it won’t be the best fit for some.

5. [Happy Planet Barista Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Planet-OatMilk-Beverage-Friendly/dp/B08J1BZN6L/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=vegan+coffee+creamer&qid=1612979190&s=grocery&sr=1-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExVERGTUZYUjA4S0RKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjMwOTkxRjZIQVVRSUw3R1hIJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwOTE1MDk3RUNFOTlYSzZZMlcmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl)

Happy Planet is a leading name in the oat milk world, and their Barista Edition is the perfect coffee creamer alternative for coffee lovers who are looking to cut out the dairy. This unflavored oat milk steams well and delivers a creamy texture similar to dairy milk, which means it is perfect for those who like lattes and other espresso-based coffee drinks.

This creamer is also nut-free, which makes it good news for those who don’t like coconut or have nut allergies that prevent them from trying other creamer alternatives!

If you depend on coffee to give yourself a mental boost, you might want to check out Rising Tide’s Elevate Creamer to maximize those benefits. Besides coconut milk powder and coconut nectar, this brand has another powerful ingredient: Lion’s Mane Mushroom! [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24266378/) have shown that this medicinal mushroom contains compounds that can actually encourage brain growth – not bad if you’re looking to get an edge from your daily cup of joe!

## More Vegan and Healthy Coffee Creamer Alternatives:

Besides these plant-based coffee substitute brands, you can also use these pantry staples to give your black coffee some flavor, sweetness, and spice:

* Honey
* Cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spices
* Maple syrup
* Cocoa powder

## Other Ways to Make Your Morning Cup Healthier

If you want to cut out the coffee completely and maximize the health benefits of your daily drinks, but don’t want to give up your caffeinated drink completely, you might also consider using vegan or plant-based coffee alternatives instead.

For example, consider matcha: this powdered green tea has been enjoying a rise in popularity among coffee fans in the past couple of years, and for good reason. Matcha contains less caffeine than coffee, so it will give you a milder brain boost that doesn’t cross the line into caffeine dependency. It also boasts a ton of [antioxidants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32290537/) like polyphenols and tannins that can fight off oxidative damage, especially when drunk daily.

Even better, you can use the same vegan coffee creamer alternatives listed below to add some sweetness to your matcha drinks! Matcha on its own has a slightly bitter taste, just like coffee, so having a creamer alternative is a great way to make the drink more enjoyable.

### Conclusion

You don’t have to give up the cream that so many of us enjoy with our cup of coffee, even if you’re cutting out the dairy or trying to eat healthier! With a huge variety of milk alternatives and with many companies focusing on creating vegan alternatives to our favorite foods, there’s a healthy coffee creamer substitute for everyone out there.
